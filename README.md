# Apple's Disapproval of Screen Recording Analytics Code

Apple reportedly has started to force app developers to remove 
the use of analytics code in their applications. The previous utilization of this code from analytics companies such as Glassbox allowed other, larger consumer-based companies such as Hotels.com and Expedia to record the screens of its users for aid in their marketing strategies. I believe Apple's strides and efforts to stop the use of these analytics code is a great move for the company as a whole in terms of its marketablility and image to the public. As consumers are given a sense of security while using many of the applications available in the App Store, they are given another reason to favor Apple products over those of its competitors.
